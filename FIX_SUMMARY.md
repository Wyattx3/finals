# 🔧 Bug Fix Summary

Date: 2025-10-27  
Version: 1.0.1  
Status: ✅ All Fixes Verified

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### 1. Players Not Saved to Database
**Problem:**
- Players were joining the game but only stored in memory
- Not persisted to database, causing data loss on bot restart
- Error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')`

**Solution:**
- Added `addPlayer()` method to `game-state-manager.js`
- Modified `join_game` callback to call `gameStates.addPlayer()`
- Players now properly saved to `game_players` table

**Files Changed:**
- `game-state-manager.js` (added `addPlayer()` method)
- `bot.js` (updated `join_game` callback)

### 2. Questions Generation Logic Error
**Problem:**
- 5 players were only generating 3 questions instead of 5
- Logic was checking conditions in wrong order
- Expected: ဘယ်သူက, ဘယ်သူ့ကို, ဘယ်နေရာမှာ, ဘာအကြောင်း, ဘယ်လိုပြော
- Actual: ဘယ်သူက, ဘယ်သူ့ကို, ဘယ်လိုပြော (missing 2 questions)

**Solution:**
- Fixed `getQuestions()` function logic
- Ensured "ဘာအကြောင်း" is always included for 4+ players
- Verified question generation for all player counts (4-8)

**Test Results:**
```
4 players: 4 questions ✅
5 players: 5 questions ✅
6 players: 6 questions ✅
7 players: 7 questions ✅
8 players: 8 questions ✅
```

**Files Changed:**
- `bot.js` (`getQuestions()` function)

### 3. Shuffled Players Not Persisted
**Problem:**
- Players were shuffled in memory but not saved to database
- Shuffle order lost on bot restart or crash
- Game state inconsistent between memory and database

**Solution:**
- Modified `startGame()` to explicitly save shuffled state
- Added `await gameStates.set(chatId, gameState)` after shuffle
- Verified shuffle persists to `game_players` table with `turn_order`

**Files Changed:**
- `bot.js` (`startGame()` function)
